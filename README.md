Network Projects

## Description ##
These folders correspond with the given projects in CS4700 Network Fundamentals class @ NEU Spring 2024. 
As part of a comprehensive networking course focused on the architecture, algorithms, and protocols of the Internet, I successfully completed six hands-on projects that deepened my understanding of various aspects of network systems. This course covered local area networking, routing, congestion control, network security, and Internet applications such as peer-to-peer and content distribution networks. Each project was designed to be systems-oriented, enabling me to build and analyze Internet applications.
