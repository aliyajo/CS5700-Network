Starter code provided by Professor Christo Wilson at Northeastern University.

## Description:
The goal of this project is to implement a simple BGP router in order to deepen
our understanding of how core internet infrastucure works by giving us
experience building & managing forwarding tables, generating route
announcements, and forwarding data packets from internet users. In the process
we learn to manipulate IP addresses and understand subnet mask notation & the
purpose of network masks. We also gain more experience with managing multiple
sockets using the select() function and poll() function.

## How to install & run:
Rather than testing our on a real network, we are testing it in a simulator
implemented in a script named `run`. The simulator comes with a suite of
configuration files in the `configs` directory that our router is able to
handle. To run the simulator, the following command is used:

> `$ ./run [config-file]`

The following libraries are used in this project:
> `argparse`, `socket`, `time`, `json`, `select`, `struct`, `sys`, `math`
